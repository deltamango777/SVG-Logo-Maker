# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This is a node.js command-line application designed to take in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. Through the use of prompts, it allows the user to achieve just that. 

- What was your motivation?
To be able to easily create svg files with a simple prompt set-up for time efficiency and convenience.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.")
The purpose of this project was to further hone skills in node command line development but also as a way to further understand the abilities it has in regard to something as useful as svg logo generation. This is the first command line app I've done that can generate more than words and data. 
- What problem does it solve?
It makes svg creation faster and more conveninent
- What did you learn?
I learned more about svg generation as well as node command line capability.

## Installation

You install the repo and then go into the command line. You call node index.js to begin the app. 

## Usage

After calling it, you are prompted with questions. Answer each one and then watch as a logo.svg file is generated in the root directory. Drag and drop that into a new tab in your web browser and it should display the desired svg based on the users' given answers.
